Time: 2/10/24 2:00pm-
agenda:
-discuss progress on the project
-any changes that need to be updated in the UML?
-future plans that have changed?
-how is health formatted (looking through the code i am wondering if i am on a different page about our plans)
-what is sudoMissiles (that name might need to be changed, not super intuitive)
-update() code in Level for missile removal should for sure be changed (i.e. it should not create a new ArrayList every single loop)
-fairly sure sudoMissiles should not exist
-double check some of the collision calculations

-proposed changes to design:
*collidesWith(Hero) returns true if the object should be deleted, otherwise it returns false
*replace all the nonplayerobject arrays with one, delete if true


UML changes:
-Hero no more dependency on MainApp
-there is a new class that draws the game over screen
