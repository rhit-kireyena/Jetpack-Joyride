Milestone 2: More Movement and Missiles (50 points)
Functionality required to earn a 100% for M2
- M1 Items 1 – 8 (above) 
1. (30%) Automatic movement/animation (things moving without keys pressed)
	The hero must fall when the jetpack turns off (and stop falling when he lands on the ground)
	The fall must be gradual, not instantaneous
	This movement/animation occurs without key presses
2. (25%) Two different kinds of missiles that move in a reasonable way are required 
	(25% for having two different kinds of enemy movements)
3. [I DONT THINK THIS IS NEEDED FOR OUR IMPLEMENTATION ] (25% ) Diagonal movement by the hero is required
	Flying diagonal movement – up arrow key (or space bar) combined with auto horizontal movement
	Falling diagonal movement – automatic falling with combined with auto horizontal movement
4. (10%) One missile that can track the hero (i.e., adjust its vertical position toward the hero’s)
5. (10%) Fully complete the Milestone 2 Report and Submit it via Gradescope

Warning: Not submitting the Milestone Report will result in a 0% on the Milestone
Your commit message says: “This is the Milestone M2 commit and is ready for grading”
Begin planning for how your implementation will handle basic collisions (e.g., missile hits hero and hero loses a life) but this will not be checked until the next milestone
